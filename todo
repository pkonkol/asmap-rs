# idea
1 lib crate to parse publicly available APIs and put them into a DB
    - get all ASNs
    - for each ASn get whois data and scrape addresses for organization
1 lib crate to resolve adresses to geolocations
    - take all ASns DB and 
1 lib crate to create UI and interactive map with AS filtering
    - rust based UI so probably yew?

binary top crate to take crate 1, then resolve its geoloc using crate two and to launch UI from crate 3 if needed
    - use 2 binaries
      - to scrape and geolocate data
      - to start map server
